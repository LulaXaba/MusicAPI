### API Development for Music Streaming & Downloading App

I'm developing with node.js a music streaming and downloading app that allows users to stream music online and download tracks to play offline. The app targets both iOS and Android devices, and I’m using MongoDB as the database for efficient storage and retrieval of data. The key features of the app include user registration and login, music search and discovery, playlists, and offline playback functionality.


**Key Features & Functional Requirements:**
1. **User Authentication & Profile Management:**
   - User registration, login, and profile management with JWT authentication.
   - Support for social logins (e.g., Google, Apple) if possible.
   - Track user activities, favorite songs, and playback history.

2. **Music Library:**
   - Allow users to browse a catalog of music by genres, artists, albums, or popularity.
   - Support search functionality for tracks, albums, and artists.
   - Provide details for each track, including artist, album, duration, etc.
   - Utilize MongoDB to store metadata about tracks, albums, and artists.

3. **Streaming & Downloading:**
   - Stream tracks with support for different quality levels.
   - Allow users to download tracks for offline playback, with encryption to protect downloaded files.
   - Provide a service to manage downloaded files and periodically check their status (to manage licenses, etc.).

4. **Playlists & Favorites:**
   - Create, edit, and delete playlists.
   - Add tracks to favorites and organize them into playlists.
   - Enable offline playlists where downloaded tracks are available without an internet connection.

5. **Offline Playback & Management:**
   - Allow downloaded tracks to be played offline.
   - Sync offline playback history with the user’s account when back online.

6. **Content Management for Admins:**
   - Admin API endpoints to upload new tracks, update metadata, and manage catalog details.
   - Support for batch uploads to streamline content management.

7. **Analytics & User Feedback:**
   - Track user interactions for personalized recommendations.
   - Collect user feedback for tracks or playlists.

**Technical Specifications:**
- **Database:** MongoDB for efficient storage of music metadata, user data, and playback history.
- **Server:** ASP.NET Core (or Node.js) with RESTful API.
- **Authentication:** JWT for secure user sessions.
- **Audio Streaming Protocol:** Support for streaming protocols optimized for music playback.
- **Encryption:** Encrypt downloaded files for offline playback.
